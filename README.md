This repository contains all the resources for the COEN 6501 [Digital System Design and Synthesis] Final Project.

Minimum design requirements are as follows: 
1. Model your circuit using structural VHDL. 
2. Chose the multiplier among existing solutions (e.g., Array Multiplier, Booth Multiplier, 
etc.) and justify your choice. 

Our cicuit involves dealing with the unsigned values so other multipliers like booth multiplier does not make sense, so we can do the array multiplier or a wallace tree multiplier.   

3. Provide a comprehensive testbench. Make sure to cover enough scenarios to validate 
the correctness of your design.
